<h1>INFO</h1>
<h2>This module is in its alpha state</h2>
<p>Queries and the functions are simple enough and adequately documented, as for the chat.js;<br>
it is a client chat interface which I have developed from scratch in a short time, it may be unstable,<br>
so use it at your own discretion. There are two parts of the interface code, the first part is the actual interface,<br>
the second part is project specific code I wrote. I left the second part in so whomever might use this module can refer to
how frontend can use the provided interface.
